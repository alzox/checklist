# checklist

Self-explanatory, it's a checklist. Though the story of why is maybe a bit interesting. No Google search for "checklist", "free to-do list", "JS checklist", or any of the other variations I tried allowed me to create one without making an account. It should just be a few lines of code chucked into an HTML file, how hard is that? I made this in my frustration...

## how to use a checklist

My specific use case for this was to create a checklist with steps before using my film camera. It's a film camera, so I can't waste a shot. Incidentally, I'm using it fully manually as the batteries cost too much. This also means I have to go through some calculations before firing, and also adjust my camera settings. These are steps that are very easily missed. Anyway, I'm blabbering at this point.

## seo

I realize I need to do people a service and try to manipulate Google's algorithm to show this page to others if they are looking for it. I haven't done SEO as it is really a dog whistle for "get rich quick entrepreneurial schemes." They were added, I should probably get into the habit of adding them to future things.
